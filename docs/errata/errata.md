# Page n - Understanding the journey to one .NET and Understanding .NET support

Even-numbered .NET releases like .NET 6 and .NET 8 have a support level named **Long Term Support (LTS)** with a duration of 3 years. Odd-numbered .NET releases like .NET 5 and .NET 7 had a support level named **Current** with a duration of 18 months. 

On June 6, 2022, the .NET team proposed to change the support level name to [**Short Term Support (STS)**](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/223) to complement the existing **Long Term Support (LTS)**. I updated the drafts of my book to reflect that change.

On October 13, 2022, the .NET team changed the name again, to [**Standard Support**](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-7-rc-2/#support), probably because Microsoft Marketing decided that "short term" sounded too negative. My editors and I scrambled to update the final drafts of my book to reflect that change.

On October 28, 2022, the .NET team changed the name *again*, to [**Standard Term Support (STS)**](https://twitter.com/mairacw/status/1585789100879069185), but it was too late to update the PDFs that are sent to print. 

*Sigh.* Such are the perils of trying to be up-to-date on release day.

In Step 1, the project name `CalculatorLibUnitTest` should be `CalculatorLibUnitTests`.
