## Page 153 - Writing a function that returns a value

At the end of this section there is a note box that explains that we could use the `C` format code to format the output as currency. If you are running on a computer in a culture that uses Euros then to show the Euro currency symbol you must enable UTF-8 encoding. Add the following statement before doing any writing to the console:
```cs
Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8;
```

None so far.
