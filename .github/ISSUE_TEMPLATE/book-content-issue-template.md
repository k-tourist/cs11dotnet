Please check that your issue is not already in the [errata aka list of corrections and improvements](https://github.com/markjprice/cs11dotnet7/blob/main/docs/errata/README.md). Please note that PRs will be ignored because code in the repo must match the print book already published. Please raise an issue instead so I can handle it appropriately. All issues will be entered into the errata once closed and fixed in the next book edition.
